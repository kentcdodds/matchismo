        <p><b>Rook</b> is a multiplayer card game that is usually played in teams.
           Generally, teammates sit across from each other.</p>
        <p>However, in the “call partner” variant, the high bidder calls a card
           (e.g. “Black 14”), and the high bidder’s partner will be the player
           holding the named card.  Players not holding the named card constitute
           the other team.  Players <b>may not signal</b> that they are the called
           partner; the only way to identify the high bidder's partner is to see
           when the called card is played.  Note that a confident high bidder can
           call a card from his or her own hand, in which case it is the high bidder
           against all other players for that hand.  When playing “call partner”,
           team members in a hand receive the same score, which is added to each
           individual’s running total.</p>
        <p>In the <span class="red">Red 1</span> variant, the
           <span class="red">Red 1</span> card is the highest trump card, even
           taking the <b>Rook Bird</b> card, and has a value of 30 points.</p>
        <p>If the high bidder is allowed to discard point cards into the nest, then
           the team that takes the last trick of the hand also captures any points
           in the nest.</p>
        <p>If trump cards are not allowed in the nest, they may still be discarded to
           the nest if that is the last option available.  For example, support point
           cards and trump cards are not allowed in the nest, but the high bidder
           cannot discard enough non-point and non-trump cards to fill the nest.
           Then s/he must discard one or more trump cards to the nest and announce that
           “there is trump in the nest”.</p>
