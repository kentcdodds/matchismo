#Matchismo (Assignment 2)

This is my implementation of Matchismo. You can find the parts that I added to this in [the issues](https://bitbucket.org/kentcdodds/assignment1/issues).

##TL;DR

###Design Decisions

####Comments (lie)

I tried to write my code in a way that it was readable enough to not require comments because I believe that comments begin to lie as soon as their written (because the code is the true holder of the truth, not comments which don't affect the run of the program). There are comments occasionally when the logic is difficult enough or the implementation is odd enough to require an explanation, but for the most part, hopefully the code is readable enough to not require comments.

###Answers to your questions

####What did you do really well, not so well?

I like that I was able to reuse a lot of code.

####What was your experience like in this assignment?

This time around things were a little more time constraining. I didn't feel like I gave myself enough time on this assignment to make it as much as it could have been. I didn't complete all the requirements, but I'm fairly pleased with some of the results of my work.

If I had more time, I would satisfy the final requirement (using an NSAttributedString for the results) and I would probably go through and refactor some of the code.

####Did it help you learn, or do you have ideas on how to improve the assignment?

The more time I spend in the language and on the platform, the better I get at it...
