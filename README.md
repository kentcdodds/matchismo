#Rook (Assignment 3)

This is my implementation of Rook Cardgame. You can find the parts that I added to this in [the issues](https://bitbucket.org/kentcdodds/assignment3/issues).

##TL;DR

###Design Decisions

I decided to follow the skeleton code given. I about died trying to do my own implementation. It was a good decision.

###Answers to your questions

####What did you do really well, not so well?

Filling out the psudo code with real code went fine. That was fairly simple and I feel like I learned valuable lessons.

####What was your experience like in this assignment?

I had an extremely hard time with the ViewController. I'm comfortable yet with the Interface builder. It's killer...

####Did it help you learn, or do you have ideas on how to improve the assignment?

I feel like I'm getting a little more comfortable with the language/platform. But I'm really having a hard time with UI stuff.
